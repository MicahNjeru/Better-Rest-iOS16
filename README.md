#  Better Rest iOS 16
__ This application uses Apple's CoreML framework to create an ML model, train the model and use it in the app to 
predict how many hours of sleep the user needs after taking a given amount of coffee in a day. __

- The ML Model was created and trained using Apple's CreateML framework.
- The data was obtained from a randomly generated csv file (do not use the data for training production ready models).
- The csv file had 10,000 entries (rows) and 4 columns.
- The target (prediction result) was the actual number of hours of sleep required given the other 3 inputs.
- More updates will be coming as I work on the project.
